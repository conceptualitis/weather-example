# Installation

To build and run this project you need Node, Go, Ruby, and Compass â€“ sorry.

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install` to get the dependencies
3. `gulp js` to build the client-side JS
4. `cd` to the `assets` directory and run `compass compile` to build the CSS

That should get everything ready to run.

# Run it

1. From the root run `npm run dev`
2. From the `server` directory, run `go run server.go`
